Important classes:

######## class Program ######

The Program class is deriving from the graphics toolkit I am using called olcPixelGameEngine.
olcPixelGameEngine makes use of OpenGl so it is a powerful graphical toolkit.

Program is equipped with a few functions. One is called OnUserCreate(), and another one is called OnUserUpdate().
OnUserCreate is called as you call the start function on an instance of Program. I have put out one global instance of Program in UFO-Cells,
with that exception UFO-Cells makes no use of global variables so far.

virtual bool OnUserCreate();
It is adviced that you don't load graphics until OnUserCreate has been called.

After OnUserCreate() has been called, OnUserUpdate() starts running.

bool Program::OnUserUpdate(float fElapsedTime){
    dt = fElapsedTime;
    Clear(olc::GREY);
    SetPixelMode(olc::Pixel::NORMAL);

    game->game_state->Update();

    SetPixelMode(olc::Pixel::NORMAL);
    return running;
}

As you see it
-Assigns dt to fElapsedTime (more on that another time)
-Clears the creen and fills a buffer with grey.
-Sets the pixelmode to make use of transparent pixles (unsure of the full set of features, but pretty sure this is one thing it does)
-Updates the active gamestate.
-Sets pixelmode to normal (Again. I don't remember why I did this or if I need to set it twice)
-returns a boolean telling the game if it should quit or keep running.
